# Web Programming Project - CGG CAFE - Team 3

The website is for a Coffee shop or a Café. It is a business website designed for the customers so they can contact and get to know about the Café. When we initially started this project for the previous module '**Building a Static Website**' it was more focused on these following things:

•	View the menu

•	Reserve tables for specific time and date

•	Find the information’s such as address, contact details, provide-give feedback, opening hours

Further continuing this project for our current '**Web Programming**' module we will be adding a few more things, such as:

• The 'Menu' page being able to take in orders - store the order datas,

• The 'Create a Booking' page is able to take in booking requests and record the data aswell,

• A new page 'Log In' is added where people can log in so they can book tables and order drinks easily.

The theme of our website is modern and cozy. We used colors such as brown, beige, white, cream which reminds people of Coffee beans, chocolate and milk. It is designed to feel welcoming and relaxing.

# Target Audience

The website is designed for people who live or visit the local area and enjoy high-quality coffee and snacks.
Some specific group of users are: 

•	Students: They usually look for a quiet and cozy space or a place to study, work on their laptops. The ‘Book a Table’ feature is perfect for them because they can ensure they have a seat for a specific amount of time.

•	Residents and tourists: People who want to meet up for a chat or just come there for relaxing or for enjoying their morning coffee in a calm and relaxing environment. They can check the prices and see the available snacks before visiting. 

•	Coffee Lovers: Customers who care about quality drinks. They visit site to see what specific drinks are served. 

•	Busy customers: People who do not have time to call the café. They prefer to use the website, order the drink and pick it up later. 

# Visual Effect

To make the website look cool and modern, we added a Parallax Scrolling Effect. 

When the user scrolls down, the background image stays still while the content moves over it. This gives the website depth and makes it more interesting than a standard static page.

We kept the navigation bar fixed at the top so users can always find the ‘menu’ or ‘book a table’ or 'Log In' buttons easily. 

# Color Palette   

We went through a few concepts of the color psychology, and we wanted to choose these colors because they represent Coffee, warm and welcoming environment also we went through accessibility principles and checked if the background and text have enough contrast.  
Here is our chosen color palette: 

•	Primary Color: Dark Coffee Brown #472717 

Usage: This is the brand color. We used it for navigation bar, footers, buttons and main headings. 
Why: It represents roasted coffee beans and gives a strong contrast against the light background. 

•	Secondary Color: Cream-Milk #FBF6F0

Usage: We used this for the text inside the navigation bar and the footer. 
Why: It is softer then pure white. It represents the milk foam on a cappuccino and looks very clear against the dark brown background. 

•	Accent Color: Mocha-Light Brown #8d6e63

Usage: We used this for the prices on the menu and for small icons. 
Why: It adds a little bit of color variation without being too bright or distracting. It connects the dark brown and the light background. 

•	Background Color: Soft White #F9F9F9

Usage: This is the background color for the menu cards and the content sections. 
Why: It makes the content look clean and modern, allowing the images of the food and coffee to stand out.
